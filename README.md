## Contributions:

[Trevor](https://github.com/trevor-clarke):
- Contributed to the integration of Printer.js.
- Helped develop all aspects of the Hobo game’s classes and functions.
- Created and modified the image assets used in the game. These include the animated hobo images, the grass images, the cobblestone, the wooden planks, the darkness gradient, etc
- Researched methods of creating darkness in the scene, determined that changing the blending mode would be the easiest way of adding the time / day features.
- Researched how to add light sources around the players
- Researched how to make cone-shaped light sources to be used on the front of the train
- Researched how to add precipitation to the game. This was interesting due to the top-down view that the game possessed.
- Assisted with the calculations of the theoretical analysis’ in the Results Report.
- Structured, formatted and contributed to the content in the Results Report.
- Generated and executed many tests outlined in the Test Report.
- Documented and recorded defects throughout the development process.
- Outlined and described the assumed engineering tasks associated with the user stories.
- Assisted with the documentation of the Product Backlog as the various tasks were completed.

- Helped with some of the logical components of the game.
- Helped create some of the visuals for the game
- Found some of the sound to be used in the game
- Helped with writing up the test report and results report
- Helped with testing some of the functionality of the code
- Created some of the User stories and effort estimates and sprint details for the product backlog
- Researched how to do product backlog, Test report, and results report
- Helped format and structure the content in deliverable
